# my-first-app

## What is this?
This is my first attempt at creating an Android app using the Java language.

## What can it do?
- You can update a number via two buttons to increment up and down.
- You can reset the number to 0 via a button.
- You can generate a random number via a button between 0 and the number previously displayed on screen.

## Why write such a complicated readme?
Its good practice to do so I suppose. Plus, my past self will get a hoot out of looking at these old projects of mine. (I know I'm reading this right now)
